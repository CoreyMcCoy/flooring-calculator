            <p>
              So you're looking to redo your floors? It can be a headache.
              Getting the measurements right, figuring out how much material you
              need, calculating costs - it's enough to make you want to put it
              off for another few weeks (jk). We created this flooring
              calculator to simplify all the mathing. Instead of crunching
              numbers yourself, you just input a few numbers and it does the
              heavy lifting for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              No guessing on how many boxes of flooring to buy. No stressing
              that you'll end up with too little or too much material. Trust us,
              itâ€™s a real time and money saver. We hope it helps.

              Ready to update your floors? Find out how much you need!
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Let's hold off on that trip to Home Depot for just a minute.
              Figuring out how much flooring you need isn't hard, but it's super
              important. Here's a quick guide to get you started:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Grab Your Tape Measure: First, measure the room where you're
                planning to lay down those new floors. Aim for the length and
                the width, rounding up to the nearest inch. And remember, rooms
                aren't always perfect rectangles, so measure the widest part
                just to be safe.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Do a Little Math: Next up, multiply the width by the length of
                the room to find out your square footage. This is how much
                flooring you'll need to cover the space.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Know Your Number: Got your square footage? Great! That's your
                magic number for when you go shopping for flooring materials.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Plan for the Oops Moments: Installing floors isn't always smooth
                sailing. Sometimes, you'll need a little extra for mistakes or
                to make sure the design lines up just right. To play it safe,
                add 5-10% more to your total area. This extra bit can save you
                from a last-minute dash to the store.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              And there you have it. With these steps, you'll buy just the right
              amount of flooring, without any waste or shortfalls. Happy
              flooring!

            <h2 class="mb-3 fs-4">How to use this square foot calculator.</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Let's break it down with an easy example, focusing on laminate
              flooring for your dining room.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Start with the Basics: Measure your room's length and width.
                Imagine it's 16' by 13'.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Pop Those Numbers In: Enter these dimensions into our
                calculator. It'll do the math and tell you the area - which, for
                our example, is 208 square feet.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Account for Extras: Expecting a bit of waste from cutting and
                fitting? Let's add a 5% waste factor for peace of mind. It's
                always better to have a little extra than to run short.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                See the New Total: With the waste factor included, the
                calculator updates your total to 218.4 square feet. This way,
                you're covered for any oops moments.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Price It Out: Now, let's talk costs. Say the scratch-resistant
                laminate you love is $2.59 per square foot.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Get the Grand Total: Multiply the cost by the total square
                footage you need. Our calculator takes care of this step too,
                showing a final price of $565.66.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              And just like that, you've got everything you need to know for
              your dining room makeover. Easy, right?

              A quick lesson on hardwood, vinyl, and laminate flooring.
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Deciding on the perfect flooring for your home can feel
              overwhelming, with all the options out there. But don't worry,
              we've got a quick guide to help you navigate through the most
              popular choices: hardwood, vinyl, and laminate flooring. Let's
              dive in:
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-3 fs-5">Hardwood Flooring</h4>
            <p>
              If you're aiming for top-tier luxury and durability, hardwood is
              the way to go. It brings a warm, classic look to any space but
              does come with a higher price tag. Installing solid hardwood might
              require a professional touch, but you can opt for more
              budget-friendly options like bamboo or cork that still give that
              high-end feel.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-3 fs-5">Vinyl Flooring</h4>
            <p>
              Looking for something super easy to install? Vinyl flooring might
              be your best bet. It comes in sheets or rolls, making it a breeze
              to lay down, and it's lighter on your wallet compared to hardwood.
              Plus, it's versatile enough to use all over your house, even in
              moisture-prone areas like the kitchen or bathroom.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-3 fs-5">Laminate Flooring</h4>
            <p>
              For those who love the look of wood, tile, or stone but are
              watching their budget, laminate flooring is a fantastic choice.
              Not only is it cost-effective and easy to care for, but
              installation is a snap thanks to click-lock designs. You'll also
              find plenty of options that are resistant to scratches and water,
              making them practical for busy homes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each of these flooring types has its own set of perks and things
              to consider. Whether you're going for luxury, ease, or
              affordability, there's something out there that's perfect for your
              space.
